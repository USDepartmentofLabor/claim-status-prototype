# Claim status prototype

This repo contains a frontend prototype for a claim status page, with the goal of addressing the following problem statement:

> In claims status tracking tools, claimants do not always know what their status means, nor when or how to act in order to access and maintain their benefits.

## Disclaimer

This public repository exists purely for the purposes of hosting a snapshot of code to serve as a reference for similar efforts, and is therefore not actively maintained. Entities wishing to use this code should do standard security due diligence and make sure to use up-to-date dependencies.

## About the prototype

This prototype is a [static web page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page). There are no dependencies on a server or database, and no user data is collected or stored. The prototype is meant to be purely informational and does not contain sensitive information. The claim info in the site is imaginary, for demo purposes only. Viewers can toggle between pre-defined scenarios demonstrating different claim status screens.

## Using the prototype

Others are welcome to use this prototype as a reference for their own work. This prototype demonstrates user interface and software design patterns that we think could work well for a claim status page. It is not meant to be a complete solution, but rather a starting point for others to adapt and integrate with their own system.
